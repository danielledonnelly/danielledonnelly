ðŸ›¸ HELLO WORLD ðŸ‘½

I'm a marketing specialist and Get Coding student. I love learning, planning, writing, editing, designing, coding, and so much more. 

I'm also a total data nerd with a penchant for spreadsheets, tables, and documentation. I have a lot of cool ideas (and admittedly some silly ones) that I want to turn into projects.

Stay tuned for updates! I plan on offering part-time freelance copywriting, design, and development services in the near future. If you'd like to work on a project together, please feel free to reach out!
