ðŸ›¸ HELLO WORLD ðŸ‘½

I'm Danielle! My background is in marketing, and I'm a Get Coding student looking to learn some new skills.

My dream is to one day be the type of marketer who can write compelling copy for a website, design a stellar user experience, and then bring it all to life via code.

Much like myself, my GitHub page is a work in progress! I'm not afraid to make mistakes or share some silly projects. I have a lot of learning and growth ahead of me!
