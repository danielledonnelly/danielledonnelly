ðŸ›¸ HELLO WORLD ðŸ‘½

I'm Danielle! I'm a marketing specialist and Get Coding student. I love planning, writing, editing, designing, coding, and so much more. 

I'm a data nerd with a penchant for spreadsheets, tables, and documentation. Fast-paced environments that value collaboration and innovation are where I thrive the most. 

Stay tuned for updates! I plan on offering part-time freelance copywriting, design, and development services in the near future.
