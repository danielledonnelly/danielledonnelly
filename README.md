ðŸ›¸ HELLO WORLD ðŸ‘½

I'm Danielle! My background is in marketing and I'm a Get Coding student looking to expand my skill set. 

I graduated from MUN in 2022 with a Bachelor of Commerce. Recently, I've been doing some marketing work in the tech industry. 

My dream is to one day be the type of marketer who can write compelling copy for a website, design a stellar user experience, and then bring it all to life via code.

Much like myself, my GitHub page is a work in progress! I'm not afraid to make mistakes or share some silly projects. I have a lot of learning and growth ahead of me!
